Moderator Guide
===============

*Power corrupts, moderator power corrupts moderately.*

Moderator Guidelines
--------------------

1. Your powers are a last resort: except in cases of grief repairs, your powers should not be used if alternative mediation is available.
2. A soft touch is often better than a crackdown. "Speak softly but carry a big stick" (unless you're dealing with griefing, see below).
3. Do not use extra powers to give yourself a gameplay advantage.
4. Community leadership and leading by example are more important than enforcing the rules.
5. Disagreements should be kept private. Issues with other moderators, or administrators should not be discussed in public.
