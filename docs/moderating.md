Moderator Guide
===============

*Power corrupts, moderator power corrupts moderately.*

Moderator Guidelines
--------------------

1. Your powers are a last resort: except in cases of grief repairs, your powers should not be used if alternative mediation is available.
2. A soft touch is often better than a crackdown. "Speak softly but carry a big stick" (unless you're dealing with griefing, see below).
3. Do not use extra powers to give yourself a gameplay advantage.
4. Community leadership and leading by example are more important than enforcing the rules.
5. Disagreements should be kept private. Issues with other moderators, or administrators should not be discussed in public.

Mod/Admin Chat
--------------

The mod and admin chat is available at https://neffy.hipchat.com/chat. You should have received an invite to this, if you didn't then please contact one of the admins.

Bans
----

Rule 1 notwithstanding, your basic tool against those who are damaging the server is the ban hammer. Essentially there are only three commands to know about here:

* `/kick <player> <message>` will forcibly disconnect a user from the server with a kick message.
* `/ban <player> <message>` will ban a user from the server with a given message. Please explain the reason for their ban in the message, this is for staff reference as much as anything else.
* `/unban <player>` will remove a ban from a player and allow them once again to connect to the server.

In some Minecraft servers, there is the option of banning players by IP address rather than username. This is disabled here, but if you do find a way to circumvent this, be warned that it is a **very bad idea**. Due to the way the server is set up, every single user will appear to come from the same IP address, and banning that IP will make it impossible for anyone to connect to the server until an admin can fix it at the console.

Monitoring
----------

In case of suspected rule-breakers, it may well be useful to actually just keep an eye on them to establish exactly what is going on rather than moving in without evidence. The `/vanish` command allows you to become physically invisible to all users, and watch people without alerting them to your presence.

You have access to a number of basic teleportation commands to move around the map for moderation purposes.
